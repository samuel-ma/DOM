/*
    CODING CHALLENGE
    
    Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the
    3 scores is calculated (so one average score per team)

    A team only wins if it has at least DOUBLE the average
    score of the other team. 
    Otherwise no team wins!

    TEST DATA ONE
    Dolphins score [44,23,71]
    Koalas score [65,54,49]

    TEST DATA TWO
    Dolphins score [85,54,41]
    Koalas score [23,34,27]

    1. Create an arrow function to calculate the average
    2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
    3. Create a function that takes the average and logs the winner
    4. Determine the winner for both DATA 1 and DATA 2
    5. Ignore draws
